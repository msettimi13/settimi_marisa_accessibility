1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,350
I want to talk about the Disney plus series,
Loki, yes, you're getting your own show.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,990
Unbelievable. This is giant.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,940
This is it. I mean, that's great.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,930
Yeah, it's it is it is amazing.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,210
I never expected it.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,870
You know, I auditioned for the for the first
Thor film 10 years ago in 2009.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,170
And I just thought I was auditioning for a
movie, you know, an interesting part

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,880
interesting movie back then.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,720
The Marvel Universe was only they just made
Iron Man.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,940
And I thought, oh, I'll have a go, didn't
expect.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,990
I didn't expect to be casted at all.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,720
So I can't believe I've got my own show.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,840
It's so exciting. We go into production next
year and.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,430
And that's about as much as I can tell you,
because

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,430
I know the way Marvel plays it, you're not
allowed to tell me anything at all.

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,620
But you you were tell me backstage that when
you auditioned for Thor, you actually

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,180
auditioned for Thor.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,890
I did. Yes, I did.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm basically at the time they were what
they were looking for, sort of less well

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,360
established actors so that the audience
didn't have an association.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,800
They were like they just wanted people to
see these new characters, these new actors in

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,430
the band. And I they would be the remit
was.

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,890
If you're over six foot and you've got blond
hair and, you know, you could come and have a

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,710
pop at it. So I actually just I never
auditioned for Loki.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,600
I only ever auditioned for Thor, which is
nuts.

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,500
And how long

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,220
Did the audition

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,080
Process I mean, it was about three months.

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,040
Was you for a second you go, this is really I
could be Thor

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,090
For a second for a little over a second.
