        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            Jimmy: I want to talk about the Disney plus series, Loki 
            <br>
            Tom: Yes 
            <br>
            Jimmy: You're getting your own show.
            <br>
            Tom: Unbelievable, ya.
            <br>
            Jimmy: This is giant.
            <br>
            Tom: This is it. It's happening.
            <br>
            (Audience Applause)
            <br>
            Tom: Yeah, it's it is it is amazing.
            I never expected it.
            You know, I auditioned for the for the first
            Thor film 10 years ago in 2009.
            And I just thought I was auditioning for a
            movie, you know, an interesting part,
            interesting movie back then
            the Marvel Universe was only they just made
            Iron Man.
            And I thought, oh, I'll have a go, didn't
            expect.
            I didn't expect to be casted at all.
            So I can't believe I've got my own show.
            It's so exciting. We go into production next
            year and
            And that's about as much as I can tell you,
            <br>
            Jimmy: Ya I was going to say, ya I know the way Marvel plays it, you're not
            allowed to tell me anything at all.
            But you you were tell me backstage that when
            you auditioned for Thor, you actually
            auditioned for Thor.
            <br>
            Tom: I did. Yes, I did.
            Basically at the time they were what
            they were looking for, sort of less well
            established actors so that the audience
            didn't have an association.
            They were like they just wanted people to
            see these new characters, these new actors.
            And I they would be the remit
            was.
            If you're over six foot and you've got blond
            hair and, you know, you could come and have a
            pop at it. So I actually just I never
            auditioned for Loki.
            I only ever auditioned for Thor, which is
            nuts.
            <br>
            Jimmy: And how long
            did the audition
            process I mean, 
            <br>
            Tom: it was about three months.
            <br>
            Jimmy: Was you so you thought for a second you go, this is really I
            could be Thor
            <br>
            Tom: For a second for a second.    
        </p>
